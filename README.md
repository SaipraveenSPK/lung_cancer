# lung_cancer Prediction

-> The effectiveness of the cancer prediction system helps people to know their cancer risk at a low cost and it also helps the people to take the appropriate decision based on their cancer risk status. The data is collected from the website online lung cancer prediction system.

-> The dataset used in the code includes various columns such as gender, age, smoking, yellow fingers, anxiety, peer pressure, chronic disease, fatigue, allergy, wheezing, alcohol consuming, coughing, shortness of breath, swallowing difficulty, chest pain, and lung cancer. By analyzing these variables and using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations, the predictive models can provide accurate assessments of a patient's risk of developing lung cancer.

-> Lung cancer prediction using multiple machine learning classification models using Scikit-learn library in Python is a code implementation that aims to develop a predictive model for detecting lung cancer in patients. The code uses 4 different machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor and Gaussian naive Bayes to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on a range of variables.
